The Public Health Applications Common Software Library (phacsl)

This repo contains reusable python software packages for use with PHA software development projects.

There are several compiled extensions included in this repository.
These are build by default, but can be excluded with optional arguments to `setup.py`.

Note that it is possible, during developemnt, to set your `PYTHONPATH` to the `src` directory.
In order to use the compiled extensions in this manner, first run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`.
